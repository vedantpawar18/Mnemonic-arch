# Node.js Interview Questions

## 1. What is Node.js?
   **Answer:**  
   _[Your answer here]_**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on **Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine** that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. It enables the creation of server-side applications using JavaScript, which traditionally ran only in the browser.

### **Key Features of Node.js**:

1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**:
   - Node.js uses an **event-driven**, **non-blocking I/O model**, making it lightweight and efficient, especially for building scalable network applications.
   
2. **Single-Threaded**:
   - Despite being **single-threaded**, Node.js can handle many requests concurrently via event looping and asynchronous callbacks.

3. **Fast Execution**:
   - The **V8 engine** compiled by Google powers Node.js, making it fast for executing JavaScript.

4. **Cross-Platform**:
   - Node.js works across various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, allowing developers to write cross-platform applications.

5. **npm (Node Package Manager)**:
   - Node.js comes with **npm**, which is the world's largest ecosystem of open-source libraries. It allows developers to easily install and manage dependencies for their projects.

6. **Real-Time Applications**:
   - Node.js is popular for building real-time applications like **chat applications**, **live updates**, and **collaborative tools** due to its event-driven nature.

7. **Microservices & APIs**:
   - Node.js is widely used in building **RESTful APIs** and **microservices** architectures.

### **Use Cases of Node.js**:
- **Web Servers**: For building scalable web applications.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Such as chat applications and collaborative tools.
- **RESTful APIs**: Node.js is great for building APIs that handle HTTP requests and serve data in JSON format.
- **Microservices**: Suitable for building distributed microservices applications.
- **Streaming Services**: Efficient in managing data streaming, like media streaming.

## 2. What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?
   **Answer:**  
## Difference between Node.js and JavaScript

### **1. Definition**:
- **JavaScript**: A **programming language** primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It runs on the client-side in a browser.
- **Node.js**: A **JavaScript runtime environment** that allows JavaScript to be executed outside the browser, typically used for building server-side applications.

### **2. Purpose**:
- **JavaScript**: Used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages on the client-side (within the browser).
- **Node.js**: Enables JavaScript to be used for server-side programming, such as building web servers, APIs, and backend services.

### **3. Environment**:
- **JavaScript**: Runs inside the browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, etc.) and interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model) to manipulate web page content.
- **Node.js**: Runs on the **server-side** and provides various built-in modules for interacting with the file system, networking, and operating system.

### **4. APIs**:
- **JavaScript**: The browser provides built-in APIs, like DOM manipulation, `window`, `document`, etc., to interact with the page and perform tasks like event handling and animations.
- **Node.js**: Provides built-in modules (e.g., `fs`, `http`, `path`, `os`) for performing server-side tasks such as handling HTTP requests, interacting with the file system, and managing networking.

### **5. Execution**:
- **JavaScript**: Typically runs on the browser’s JavaScript engine (like Chrome's V8 engine or Firefox's SpiderMonkey) to process and execute code.
- **Node.js**: Executes JavaScript code outside of the browser using the V8 engine on the server-side.

### **6. Use Cases**:
- **JavaScript**: Primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers, such as handling user events, manipulating the DOM, and performing AJAX requests.
- **Node.js**: Used for building scalable web servers, APIs, real-time applications (e.g., chat apps), and handling file I/O, database connections, etc.

### **7. Concurrency**:
- **JavaScript**: In the browser, JavaScript runs on a single thread (with event-driven concurrency, though it's limited to the browser environment).
- **Node.js**: Uses an event-driven, **non-blocking I/O model**, which allows handling multiple concurrent requests without blocking, even though it runs on a single thread.

### **8. Installation**:
- **JavaScript**: No installation needed – it's built into web browsers.
- **Node.js**: Needs to be installed separately as it provides the runtime for JavaScript on the server.

## 3. Is Node.js single-threaded?
   **Answer:**  
## Is Node.js Single-Threaded?

### **Yes, Node.js is single-threaded**, but with important caveats:

1. **Single-Threaded Event Loop**:
   - Node.js runs on a **single thread** (main thread) which executes JavaScript code using the event loop.
   - This allows Node.js to handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the execution of code. For example, while waiting for a file to be read or an HTTP request to complete, Node.js can continue executing other tasks.
   
2. **Non-Blocking I/O**:
   - Although Node.js runs on a single thread, it leverages **non-blocking I/O operations**. When a task (like reading a file or querying a database) is initiated, Node.js delegates this task to the system (outside the JavaScript thread) and continues processing other tasks. Once the task is complete, it notifies Node.js via callbacks.
   
3. **Worker Threads and Child Processes**:
   - While the main thread is single-threaded, Node.js can offload CPU-heavy operations to **worker threads** or **child processes** (using the `cluster` module or the `worker_threads` module) to take advantage of multi-core processors. This allows Node.js to handle tasks in parallel when needed.

4. **Event Loop**:
   - The event loop is the core of Node.js’s concurrency model. It ensures that Node.js can handle many requests simultaneously by pushing tasks (callbacks, promises, events) onto a queue and processing them one by one.

### **Advantages of the Single-Threaded Model**:
   - **Lightweight**: Since Node.js uses a single thread, it consumes fewer resources compared to traditional server-side environments that require multiple threads.
   - **Efficient**: The non-blocking nature of the event loop allows Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently.
   - **Simpler Code**: Developers don’t have to manage multiple threads and complex synchronization issues.

### **Drawbacks**:
   - **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: Node.js can be less efficient when handling CPU-bound tasks (like heavy computation) because they can block the event loop, making the server unresponsive. This can be mitigated using worker threads or moving heavy tasks to separate processes.
