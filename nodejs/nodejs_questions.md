# Question: What is the Event Loop in Node.js?
   **Answer:** The Event Loop allows Node.js to handle many tasks without blocking.
   **Explanation:** Imagine a waiter at a restaurant taking multiple orders at once. They donâ€™t wait for one dish to be ready before taking another order. Instead, they keep checking and serving as soon as food is ready.
   ```js
   console.log('Start');
   setTimeout(() => console.log('Hello'), 0);
   console.log('End');
   ```
   Output:
   Start
   End
   Hello (this runs later because of the event loop).
